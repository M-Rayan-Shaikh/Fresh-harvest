Objective:
The main objective of this project is to design a modern, visually appealing, and user-friendly website for a fictional brand called Fresh Harvest, which sells fresh organic vegetables online. The website showcases products, provides business information, and includes interactive design elements using only HTML and CSS.
1.	Technologies Used:
•	Language: HTML and CSS
•	Editor Used: Visual Studio Code
2.	Problem Description
What:
Manual or outdated vegetable-selling platforms lack visual appeal and user engagement.
Customers struggle to find organic products with clear pricing and descriptions online.
Why:
A well-designed website can attract more customers, improve trust, and streamline product discovery.
Static websites (HTML/CSS) are lightweight and ideal for small businesses with limited technical resources.
4.	Methodology:
•	HTML for structured content.
•	Internal CSS for styling (colours, grids, hover effects).
•	Mobile-first approach with media queries for responsiveness.
•	CSS Grid/Flexbox for product card layouts.
•	Parallax effect in the "About" section for visual engagement.
5.	Website Structure:
The webpage is structured using semantic HTML elements and styled entirely using internal CSS. It includes the following main sections:
Header:
•	Full-screen hero section with a background image and overlay.
•	Brand name with a highlighted span.
•	Tagline introducing the brand's mission.
•	“Shop Now” call-to-action button.
•	Developer signature placed at the top-right.
Navigation Bar:
Navigation Bar Which Links To:
•	Home
•	Products
•	About
•	Contact
Styled With Dark Green Background and Hover Effects
Products Section:
Responsive Grid Layout Featuring:
•	Juicy Tomatoes
•	Fresh Cabbage
Each product is presented in a card layout with:
•	Image Background Using Class Specific CSS
•	Title, Price and Description
•	Add to Cart Button
About Section:
•	Full-width section with a fixed background image and semi-transparent overlay.
•	Brief description of the brand’s mission and values.
•	Includes a “Learn More” button for engagement.
Footer:
•	Brand Name
•	Social Media Links
•	Contact Details
•	University Name
6.	Design and Aesthetics:
•	Colour Palette: Shades of green (#4a7c59, #8bc34a, #2d6a4f) to match the organic/fresh theme.
•	Typography: Clean, modern sans-serif fonts for readability.
•	Visual Hierarchy: Use of headings, section titles, and hover effects to guide user interaction.
•	Responsive Design: Ensures the layout adapts for smaller screens using media queries.
7.	Key Features:
Responsive Design:	Layout adjusts on mobile devices.
CSS Effects:	Smooth hover transitions for buttons and product cards.
Grid Layout:	Product section uses CSS Grid for adaptive alignment.
Sticky Navbar:	Navigation remains at the top for better UX.
Fixed Background:	About section uses a parallax-style effect.
Developer Signature:	Attribution included in a non-intrusive way.
8.	Limitations and Future Enhancements:
Limitations:
•	Lacks backend integration (e.g., cart functionality, dynamic data).
•	Static content only – no JavaScript used for interactivity.
•	Products are hardcoded; no database connectivity.
Future Enhancements:
•	Add user login and admin panel.
•	Fetch product data from a JSON or database.
•	Optimize for performance and SEO.
9.	Project Scope:
Included:
•	Responsive homepage with navigation, product grid, and footer.
•	Static product display (images, prices, descriptions).
•	Visual enhancements (hover effects, fixed backgrounds).
Excluded:
•	Backend functionality (e.g., cart, payments).
•	Dynamic content (e.g., user logins, databases).
Assumptions:
•	Target users prefer simplicity over complex features.
•	Content updates are infrequent (no CMS required).
10.	Solution Application Areas:
•	Small Organic Farms: Showcase products online.
•	Local Businesses: Template for cost-effective web presence.
•	Educational Tool: Demonstrates HTML/CSS fundamentals.
